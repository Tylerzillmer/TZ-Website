<h1>How does the population affect the energy consumtpion in the US?</h1>
<p>For this project we decided to analyze three different states in the US, California, New Jersey, and Texas. Each state had its data set on tuva.<br>
 We decided to use these heat graphs as a way to visually incorporate three variables. The heat colors are also better for those looking at it to visualize the data</p>
 <h2>Data Visuals and descriptions</h2>
 <img src="TZ-Website/Capture26.PNG" style="width:1200px;height:600px;">
 <p>This graph is a visual of the energy consumption in NJ, you can see a common trend through out most of the graph,<br>
  the higher the population, the more energy consumption, this is mostly true except for the end where there was<br>
more people but they decreased energy consumption.

<p> This is a graph of the energy consumption in Texas. You can see a very distinct trend in the population,<br>
  year and energy consumption, it is very clear that over time the poulation increase which also creates more energy<br>
  consumption.

<h2> Creative Visuals</h2>

 <p>We can see in this graph the stats of 1985, similar to the previous graphs we have used color to visualize population.<br>
  In 1985 there was a fairly high poplation in Califronia and New Jersey which was represented by the lrager images, and they also had a high energy consumption rate.<br>
  As for Texas their population was lower so they used less energy.<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> After a lot of research and analysis we found that there is a consistent trend between the relationship of poulation and energy consumption,<br> as population and time increased the energy consumption also grew. They happened at the same rate.<br>
 We thought a lot about this and we think that the government should create ways to use the growing population to decrease thet energy consumption,<br> this will be very sustainable in the future. </p>
